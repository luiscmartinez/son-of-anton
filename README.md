# codogotchi

Codogotchi is the RPG layer on top of Codex- and Claude-format pets. Your
agent activity feeds XP, HP, stage advancement, and loot. The data lives in
Convex; the macOS pet that will render this data is a later phase.

**Status:** Phase 01 — private validation. Two-user run on Convex Cloud.
No public surface yet. See [`docs/product/plans/phase-01-as-shipped.md`](docs/product/plans/phase-01-as-shipped.md)
for what shipped vs what the plan intended, and
[`docs/product/plans/phase-01.md`](docs/product/plans/phase-01.md) for the original
plan and explicit deferrals.

## What ships in Phase 01

- A Bun-powered CLI (`codogotchi`) with `setup`, `sync`, `status`, `loot`,
  `config`, `vacation`.
- A hook binary (`codogotchi-hook`) that writes a documented animation-state
  vocabulary to `~/.codogotchi/state.json` on every Claude Code / Codex
  lifecycle event.
- XP / Health / Loot engine wired through the CLI and re-used inside Convex's
  `syncProfile` mutation, so XP is computed server-side and the CLI is a dumb
  pipe + cache reader.
- Four signal sources: Claude Code JSONL, Codex JSONL, GitHub merged PRs (with
  `scorePR` quality enrichment), Wakatime hours. **Forward-only:** each source
  reads activity since the last sync (or since install time on first sync)—no
  historical backfill. Per-source XP **accumulates** on each successful sync.
- Convex Cloud schema covering `profiles` (with HP fields), `loot_events`,
  `users`; a `syncProfile` mutation; an HTTP action receiving signals from
  the CLI.
- Scheduled-sync installers for launchd and cron, a `scorePR` debug log, and a
  validation runbook.

Public surface (web armory, leaderboard, OAuth, OG image, install script,
macOS pet, visible loot rendering) is intentionally deferred. See
[`docs/product/plans/phase-01.md#explicit-deferrals`](docs/product/plans/phase-01.md#explicit-deferrals).

## Install (private, source build)

There is no npm publish yet. The CLI runs from source via Bun.

```bash
bun install
bun run packages/cli/bin/codogotchi.ts setup
```

`setup` prompts for your codogotchi **handle**, then **GitHub username** and **PAT**
(one after the other). Merged-PR signals only work when **both** are set; skipping
either leaves GitHub PR XP off until you fix it with `codogotchi config set` or
`setup --force`. Wakatime and GitHub credentials are optional.

Both binaries live under `packages/cli/bin/`. Wire them into your `PATH` (or
symlink them into `~/.local/bin/`) for convenience.

## CLI surface

```
codogotchi setup                              First-run config + hook install
codogotchi sync                               One sync cycle (all four sources)
codogotchi status                             Cached profile, HP, recent loot
codogotchi loot [--limit N] [--tier T]        Loot history from ~/.codogotchi/loot.log
codogotchi config get <key>                   Read a dotted config key
codogotchi config set <key> <value>           Write a typed value
codogotchi config list                        Full config as JSON (secrets redacted)
codogotchi vacation on [--until YYYY-MM-DD]   Pause HP decay
codogotchi vacation off                       Resume HP decay
codogotchi vacation status                    Show vacation state
```

Environment overrides:

| Var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODOGOTCHI_HOME` | `~/.codogotchi` | Config / cache / log root |
| `CODOGOTCHI_USER_ROOT` | OS home | Home dir used for hook installation |

## Where data lives

| Path | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.codogotchi/config.json` | `setup`, `config` | Credentials and health knobs |
| `~/.codogotchi/profile.json` | `sync` | Local cache of Convex profile |
| `~/.codogotchi/state.json` | `codogotchi-hook` | Animation state for renderers |
| `~/.codogotchi/sync.log` | `sync` | Per-source success / failure (rotated) |
| `~/.codogotchi/loot.log` | `sync` (via Convex) | Loot history (for `loot`) |
| `~/.codogotchi/scorePR.log` | `sync` | `scorePR` heuristic decisions |
| Convex `profiles`, `loot_events`, `users` | server | Canonical state |

## Health semantics

Three knobs in `~/.codogotchi/config.json`:

- `health.weekend_decay` — when `false` (default), HP does not drop Sat/Sun in
  the local timezone.
- `health.grace_days` — days of inactivity before HP starts decaying.
- `health.vacation_until` — ISO date through which HP decay is suspended; set
  via `codogotchi vacation on`.

## Contracts to read before extending

- [`docs/contracts/animation-state-vocabulary.md`](docs/contracts/animation-state-vocabulary.md) —
  closed-enum state vocabulary the hook writes and the macOS app will read.
- [`docs/contracts/soa-event-feed.md`](docs/contracts/soa-event-feed.md) —
  NDJSON event feed Son-of-Anton emits that the hook consumes for explicit
  delivery-gate signals.
- [`docs/contracts/convex-deployment.md`](docs/contracts/convex-deployment.md) —
  deployment topology.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun test                       # engine tests (fast)
bun run verify:quiet           # biome check (lint + format)
bun run spellcheck             # cspell
bun run ci:quiet               # publication gate (verify + spellcheck)
```

Multi-ticket phase delivery is driven via the Son-of-Anton orchestrator
checked in under `.son-of-anton/`. See `AGENTS.md` for skill triggers and
`.son-of-anton/docs/template/delivery/delivery-orchestrator.md` for the
command surface.
