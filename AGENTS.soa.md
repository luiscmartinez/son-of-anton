## Son-of-Anton Skill Triggers

Use these skills when working in a consumer repo that has installed Son-of-Anton
via `git subtree add --prefix .son-of-anton`.

- **`soa`** — canonical entrypoint: `/soa plan`, `/soa decompose`, `/soa execute`, `/soa resume`, `/soa triage-ticket`, `/soa triage-standalone`. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/soa/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-son-of-anton-ethos`** — invoke automatically for any approved multi-ticket phase/epic or standalone PR delivery. Trigger keywords: execute, begin, start, deliver, implement, continue, resume, run, drive, carry, work on, or explicit mention of `son of anton`. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/son-of-anton-ethos/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-pr-review`** — triage AI-generated PR review comments. Trigger: user says `triage`. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-grill-me`** — stress-test a plan before accepting it. Use before any plan or ticket decomposition is finalized. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/grill-me/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-closeout-stack`** — squash-merge completed stacked PRs onto main after developer approval. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/closeout-stack/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-enter-worktree`** — bootstrap a fresh git worktree with deps and env before starting ticket work. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/enter-worktree/SKILL.md`.
- **`soa-write-retrospective`** — write a phase or epic retrospective to `docs/product/retrospectives/`. Skill at `.son-of-anton/.agents/skills/write-retrospective/SKILL.md`.

## Subagent Review Rules

When invoking a review subagent during orchestrated delivery:

- **Subagent selection:** pass `--subagent <claude-cli|codex-cli>` to `subagent-review`, or set `subagentRunner` in `orchestrator.config.json`. The CLI tries the preferred runner first, then the other, then records an honest `skipped` if neither is available. Missing both is a hard error — SoA ships no silent default.
- **Reconciliation:** run `reconcile-subagent-review` after subagent patches and before `open-pr`. Ledger outcomes are `clean | patched | deferred | skipped`. Use `record-deferred` or `open-pr --ack-reconciliation` when consciously not patching actionable findings.
- **Adversarial prompt required:** the subagent prompt must assume the implementation has holes and find them. Do not rationalize away anything you notice — flag it and let the human decide. A checklist of "did the ticket spec land?" is not a review.
- **No rationalizing away findings:** the subagent must not suppress or downplay what it finds. Flag everything; the human decides what to act on.

## Pre-Commit Discipline

**Prerequisite:** Son-of-Anton requires a global `bun` install. All CLI delivery commands run via `bun run deliver …`.

Before committing: run `bun run format`, then `bun run verify` (or `bun run verify:quiet` for a quieter pass). Use `bun run ci:quiet` as the final publication gate before opening a PR.
