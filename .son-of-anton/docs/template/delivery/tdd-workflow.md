# TDD Workflow For This Repo

This repo should use red-green-refactor, not horizontal slicing.

## Working Rules

- test behavior through public interfaces
- prefer integration-style tests
- mock only system boundaries
- write one failing test at a time
- write the minimum code to pass
- refactor only after green

## Public Interfaces To Test

Test behavior through your project's public interfaces — CLI commands, API endpoints, data layer operations, adapter behaviors. The specific interfaces depend on your project.

Avoid tests that assert:

- private helper behavior
- internal call counts
- module-to-module implementation detail

## Boundary Fakes Allowed

Use fakes or local test servers only at true system boundaries:

- external HTTP APIs or feed sources
- external services (databases, message queues, RPC servers)
- time, when timestamps are load-bearing

Do not mock:

- internal business logic modules
- internal normalization or transformation helpers
- internal orchestration functions

## Red-Green-Refactor Pattern

For each ticket:

1. Declare `Red: required` in the ticket metadata for code behavior, or `Red: skip` when there is no testable behavior.
2. For `Red: required`, write one failing test against a public behavior.
3. Commit the failing test with a `[red]` suffix.
4. Run `bun run deliver --plan <plan-path> post-red` before implementation.
5. Implement the smallest code needed to make it pass.
6. Refactor for readability only after the test is green.
7. Stop and review before taking the next behavior slice.

`Red: skip` is the explicit metadata signal for tickets with no testable
behavior, such as pure docs, scaffolding, ops, or deployment work. Branches that
touch only `.md` or `.json` files also skip the red gate structurally.

## Example Ticket Rhythm

Good sequence:

1. Implement the first failing behavior end-to-end.
2. Add the next observable behavior on top.
3. Each step touches the full vertical stack.

Bad sequence:

- add all modules first
- add persistence later
- add tests after the entire feature works

## Pre-PR subagent review (orchestrated code tickets)

After implementation is green and `post-verify` is recorded, code tickets with
`subagentReview` enabled follow the orchestrator's two-step pre-PR gate (not part of
red-green-refactor itself, but mandatory before `open-pr`):

1. Primary agent fills `docs/template/delivery/adversarial-review-template.md` from the diff and ticket spec.
2. `write-subagent-adversarial-review` persists that prompt.
3. `subagent-review --preferred-runner …` runs the advisory runner against the written prompt.
4. Primary agent applies any prudent patches from findings, then `open-pr`.

The runner must not modify files; only the primary agent commits `[subagent-review]` fixes.
See `delivery-orchestrator.md` for policy variants (`required`, `skip_doc_only`, `disabled`).

## Definition Of Done

A ticket is done when:

- its new public behavior is covered by tests
- its `Red:` metadata honestly says whether a failing-test gate applies
- tests are green
- code only includes the minimum support needed for that behavior
- README or docs changes needed for that slice are included
- the delivery ticket doc contains a short `## Rationale` section explaining why this was the smallest acceptable path
- unresolved follow-up work is captured in the next ticket, not hidden in comments

## Suggested Test Split

Keep the suite small and behavior-focused:

- integration tests for CLI or API entry points and end-to-end pipelines
- focused tests for core business logic and transformation behavior
- adapter tests for external service boundaries and failure paths

## Runtime Portability Notes

- prefer standard APIs over runtime-specific ones when both are sufficient
- avoid shelling out to platform-specific system tools in tests
- run the full CI command (not just typecheck) before considering a ticket green

## Learning-Oriented Review Prompts

After each ticket, review with these questions:

- what behavior went red first
- what code was the minimum to go green
- why was this the smallest acceptable implementation
- what alternative was considered and why was it rejected
- what refactor improved clarity without changing behavior
- what did we intentionally not build yet

## Suggested Rationale Template

Use this short template in the delivery ticket doc's `## Rationale` section:

- `Red first:` ...
- `Why this path:` ...
- `Alternative considered:` ...
- `Deferred:` ...

If later review or validation adds non-redundant findings, append them to the same section rather than creating a separate rationale artifact.
