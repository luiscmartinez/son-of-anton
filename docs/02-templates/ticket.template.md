# PN.NN [Ticket Title]

Size: 2 points
Scope: <codebase-area>  (optional — omit if scope is unclear)

## Outcome

- [Bullet: what is demonstrably true when this ticket is done]
- [Each bullet should be independently verifiable]

## Red

- [Write a failing test that proves the behavior is missing]
- [Tests should be behavior-first, not implementation-first]
- Run the test suite and confirm the new test fails
- Commit with suffix `[red]`: `test(PN.NN): <description> [red]`
- Do not write any implementation until this commit exists on the branch

## Green

- [Implement the smallest change that makes the failing test pass]
- [Do not over-engineer — just make it green]

## Refactor

- [Extract, rename, or simplify without changing behavior]
- [Only refactor what you touched — no opportunistic cleanup]

## Review Focus

- [What a reviewer should pay attention to]
- [Public API shape, error ergonomics, edge cases]
- [What was intentionally deferred and why]
- For tickets that build a client-side helper constructing an API URL: verify the server-side handler reads and uses the params that `<helper>` sends — check both sides of the boundary, not just each in isolation.

## Rationale

> Append here (do not edit above) when behavior or trade-offs change during implementation.

Red first: [what test failed first]
Why this path: [why this implementation was the smallest acceptable]
Alternative considered: [one rejected alternative and why]
Deferred: [what was intentionally left out of this ticket]
