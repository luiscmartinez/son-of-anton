# P2.08 Transition log — NDJSON writer + heartbeat + rotation

Size: 2 points
Type: feat
Scope: menubar
Red: required

## Outcome

- `apps/menubar/Sources/TransitionLog.swift` exposes a `TransitionLog` type that:
  - Appends one NDJSON line on every observed state change.
  - Appends one heartbeat NDJSON line every 60 minutes if no state change has occurred in that window. Heartbeats reset on any real state change.
  - Writes to `~/.codogotchi/state-transitions.log` by default; path overridable via dependency injection (for tests and for demo mode using a sandboxed path).
  - Rotates the log when its size exceeds 10MB on a write: rename existing file to `state-transitions.log.1` (overwriting any prior `.1`), open a fresh log file. Single backup; no `.2`/`.3`.
- NDJSON line shape (one line per event):
  ```json
  {"ts":"2026-05-20T14:32:11.123Z","state":"implementing","prev":"idle","schema_version":1,"source_origin":"claude_code","source_kind":"tool_use","source_name":"Edit"}
  ```
  Heartbeat line shape:
  ```json
  {"ts":"...","state":"idle","heartbeat":true,"schema_version":1}
  ```
- `source_origin`, `source_kind`, `source_name` are pulled from the snapshot's `source_event` when available; null/absent when not.
- The live polling driver (P2.07) and demo driver (P2.06) both call `TransitionLog.recordTransition(snapshot:previousState:)` on every observed state change. Heartbeats are timer-driven inside the log, not driven by the polling driver.
- Tests at `apps/menubar/Tests/MenubarTests/TransitionLogTests.swift`:
  - `recordTransition(snapshot:previousState:)` writes a valid NDJSON line containing the expected fields.
  - Writing enough lines to exceed 10MB triggers exactly one rotation; the `.log.1` file exists; the `.log` is reset to a fresh (smaller) state.
  - With a fast-forwardable clock (injected), no transitions for >60 minutes triggers a heartbeat line.
  - Heartbeat lines do not affect rotation accounting (or they do, depending on implementation — pick one explicitly; the test asserts the chosen behavior).
- `notes/private/phase-02-swift-notes/P2.08-transition-log.md` lands in this PR explaining: `FileHandle` append-mode writes in Swift, ISO-8601 timestamp formatting (`ISO8601DateFormatter`), and how to inject a clock for testability.

## Red

- Write `TransitionLogTests` first. Inject a clock and a path. Run `bun run mac:test`; confirm failures.
- Commit `[red]`: `test(P2.08): transition log writes NDJSON, heartbeats hourly, rotates at 10MB [red]`.

## Green

- Implement `TransitionLog` with append-mode `FileHandle`, ISO-8601 timestamp formatter (use a single static formatter to avoid the well-known Swift formatter cost), JSON serialization via `JSONEncoder`.
- Implement the heartbeat timer as a separate `Timer` (or via the same poll-tick infrastructure — pick one).
- Implement size-check rotation: on each write, if file size exceeds 10MB after this write, rotate.
- Wire `recordTransition` calls from the live polling driver and demo driver.

## Refactor

- Confirm the file handle is opened lazily on first write (don't open at app startup just to write hours later).
- Confirm rotation is atomic enough that a crash mid-rotation leaves either the old `.log` or a fresh `.log` and a populated `.log.1` — never an empty `.log` with lost data.
- Confirm the heartbeat timer is invalidated cleanly on app shutdown.

## Review Focus

- NDJSON line format matches the product plan's stated shape; field names match the contract doc's `source_event` field names (`origin`, `kind`, `name`).
- Rotation threshold (10MB) matches `sync.log`'s convention. If `sync.log`'s actual rotation differs (e.g., 10MiB vs. 10MB), match it.
- Heartbeat cadence is honestly tested with an injectable clock — no `Thread.sleep(60 * 60)` in tests.
- File handle lifecycle: opened once on first write, kept open for the process lifetime, closed on shutdown.

## Rationale

> Append here (do not edit above) when behavior or trade-offs change during implementation.

Red first: log line shape, rotation, and heartbeat each have failing tests before code lands.
Why this path: per-state-change + hourly heartbeat balances "activity-proportional file size" with "liveness signal in the log itself." Chosen over per-poll-tick (too noisy) and per-change-only (no liveness).
Alternative considered: shared rotation logic with the TS-side `sync.log` rotation. Rejected — ~20 lines of Swift is not worth a polyglot dependency boundary; matching the *convention* (10MB cap, single `.log.1` backup) in documentation is enough.
Deferred: structured query tooling over the log, daily rotation, multi-file rolling buffers.
Contract note: if line shape deviates from this ticket's stated form during implementation, update the product plan + this ticket in the same PR.
