# P2.05 Swift MenubarRenderer — NSStatusItem + continuous-loop animation

Size: 2 points
Type: feat
Scope: menubar
Red: required

## Outcome

- `apps/menubar/Sources/MenubarRenderer.swift` exposes a `MenubarRenderer` type that owns the `NSStatusItem` and is driven by an external state stream (typed input: `ActivityState` plus a `VisualMode` enum with cases `.normal` and `.desaturated`).
- Renderer behavior:
  - When state is `.idle`/`.implementing`/`.runningTests`/`.celebrating` with `.normal` visual mode, animates that state's frames (from `MaliPet.frames(for:)`) on a 1-second-per-cycle continuous loop. Loop is infinite while the state is held.
  - On state transition, the new state's loop begins from frame 0 on the next animation tick.
  - `.desaturated` visual mode renders the current state (typically `.idle`) with reduced saturation — implemented via a `CIFilter` (`CIColorControls` with `inputSaturation = 0`) applied to the current frame, or by pre-computing a desaturated frame cache at init.
  - All `NSStatusItem.button.image` writes happen on the main thread (`@MainActor` or explicit dispatch).
- Frame timing: total animation duration is 1 second per cycle. Frame interval = `1000 / frameCount` milliseconds. Implemented via `Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval:repeats:)` on the main run loop.
- The renderer exposes `update(state:visualMode:)` as its sole public mutation entrypoint. It does not read `state.json` directly (that's P2.07's job).
- Tests at `apps/menubar/Tests/MenubarTests/MenubarRendererTests.swift`:
  - After `update(state: .implementing, visualMode: .normal)`, the renderer's current frame source is the implementing row's frames.
  - After a second `update(state: .runningTests, ...)`, the renderer swaps to the running-tests row starting at frame 0.
  - After `update(state: .idle, visualMode: .desaturated)`, the rendered image is visibly desaturated (asserted via a pixel sample or by checking that the active filter chain includes `CIColorControls` with `saturation = 0`).
- `notes/private/phase-02-swift-notes/P2.05-menubar-renderer.md` lands in this PR explaining: `NSStatusItem` lifecycle, `@MainActor` and AppKit threading, `Timer` on the main run loop vs. `DispatchSourceTimer`, and `CIFilter`-based image desaturation in TS-dev terms.

## Red

- Write `MenubarRendererTests` first using a test-friendly seam — e.g., the renderer accepts an injected "image sink" closure in tests instead of writing directly to a real `NSStatusItem`. Run `bun run mac:test` and confirm failures.
- Commit `[red]`: `test(P2.05): renderer animates floor states and supports desaturated mode [red]`.

## Green

- Implement the renderer with the smallest code that passes tests. Use a `Timer` on the main run loop; do not introduce `DispatchSource`.
- Implement desaturation as a single `CIFilter` applied to the current frame before assigning to `statusItem.button.image`.
- Wire the renderer into the existing `MenubarApp.swift` so that the running app uses this renderer (the demo and live drivers in later tickets will call `update(state:visualMode:)`).

## Refactor

- Confirm the timer is invalidated and re-created on state transition (or the timer continues firing and the renderer indexes into the current state's frame array — either pattern is fine; pick one and stick with it).
- Confirm desaturation doesn't recompute the filter chain per frame if a pre-computed desaturated cache is cheaper.
- Confirm the renderer does not hold a strong reference cycle through the timer's closure (a known AppKit pitfall).

## Review Focus

- AppKit threading: every `statusItem.button.image = ...` happens on the main actor. No background-thread mutations.
- Timer ownership and invalidation: no stale timers firing after state transitions.
- Desaturation approach: documented choice (filter-per-frame vs. cached frames). Either OK; pick one explicitly.
- Test seam: the renderer is testable without a real `NSStatusItem`, ideally without requiring the test to run under a full `NSApplication` event loop.

## Rationale

> Append here (do not edit above) when behavior or trade-offs change during implementation.

Red first: tests assert state-transition behavior and desaturation mode before any renderer exists.
Why this path: continuous-loop while-active animation policy was chosen over Codex's 3-cycle burst pattern because codogotchi has continuous polling (not one-shot triggers); continuous loop is simpler, less code, and aligns with the always-on menu-bar context.
Alternative considered: Codex-mirror 3-cycle burst with idle settle. Rejected for unnecessary state-machine complexity and a felt mismatch with continuous polling.
Deferred: cross-fade transitions between states, frame interpolation, per-state custom durations beyond the 1-second total. All Phase 03 polish.
Contract note: none expected.
