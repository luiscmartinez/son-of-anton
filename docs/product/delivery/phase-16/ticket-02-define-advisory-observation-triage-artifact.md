# P16.02 Define Advisory Observation Triage Artifact

Size: 3 points
Type: feat
Scope: delivery
Red: required

## Outcome

- SOA has a structured advisory-observation triage artifact format.
- The artifact records source report path, ticket id, observation text, disposition, rationale, and optional patch commit or follow-up reference.
- Valid dispositions are exactly `patched`, `rejected`, `deferred`, `already-covered`, and `converted-to-ticket`.
- Non-patched dispositions require a non-empty rationale.
- Malformed artifacts are rejected with clear validation errors.

## Red

- Add tests that fail until the artifact schema exists:
  - Round-trip a valid artifact with all five dispositions.
  - Reject an unknown disposition.
  - Reject a non-patched disposition without rationale.
  - Accept a patched disposition with a commit SHA.
  - Preserve source report and ticket identity.
- Commit with suffix `[red]`: `test(P16.02): define advisory observation triage artifact [red]`.
- Do not write implementation until this commit exists on the branch.

## Green

- Add artifact types, validation, read, and write helpers for advisory-observation triage.
- Store the schema in delivery tooling, not in the subagent runner ledger.
- Keep the artifact append/update semantics deterministic so re-running triage does not duplicate identical decisions.

## Refactor

- Share simple validation helpers with existing delivery artifact code only when it reduces real duplication.
- Keep the disposition artifact independent from external AI review triage artifacts.

## Review Focus

- Verify the artifact answers: what was observed, where did it come from, what did the primary decide, and why?
- Verify the schema does not imply advisory observations are blocking defects.
- Verify patched and non-patched disposition requirements match the product plan.

## Rationale

> Append here (do not edit above) when behavior or trade-offs change during implementation.

Red first: [what test failed first]
Why this path: [why this implementation was the smallest acceptable]
Alternative considered: [one rejected alternative and why]
Deferred: [what was intentionally left out of this ticket]
Contract note: record any deviation from the ticket metadata contract here, including missing/incorrect `Type:` or non-compliant `Scope:` fields, and why it happened.
